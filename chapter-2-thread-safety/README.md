Threads and locks are just *methods* for achieving thread-safe code.

Writing thread-safe
code is, at its core, about managing access to state, and in particular to shared,
mutable state.

Object's state = 'its data' (state variables (instance or static fields)).
In fact, it is all the data that can affect its behavior.

Whether an object needs to be thread-safe depends on whether it will be accessed from
multiple threads. Making an object thread-safe requires synchronization to coordinate
access to its mutable state.

`Fail in coordination = data corruption + other undesirable consquences`.

**RULE:** `Whenever more than one thread accesses a given state variable, and one of them might
write to it, they all must coordinate their access to it using synchronization.`

What are the mechanisms?

* `synchronized` keyword (exclusive locking);
* `volatile` variables;
* explicit locks;
* atomic variables.

If multiple threads access the same mutable state variable without appropriate synchronization, `your program is broken`
.
There are three ways to fix it:

* Don't share the state variable across threads;
* Make the state variable immutable;
* Use synchronization whenever accessing the state variable.

**RULE:** `It is far easier to design a class
to be thread-safe than to retrofit it for thread safety later`

**RULE:** `When designing thread-safe classes, good object-oriented techniques -
encapsulation, immutability, and clear specification of invariants â€” are
your best friends.`

It is always a good practice first to make your code right, and then
make it fast. Even then, pursue optimization only if your performance measurements and requirements tell you that
you must, and if those same measurements
tell you that your optimizations actually made a difference under realistic conditions.

A program that consists entirely of thread-safe classes may not be thread-safe, and a thread-safe
program may contain classes that are not thread-safe.

## 2.1 What is thread safety?

**Correctness concept:** `Class conforms to its specification.
Good specification defines invariants constraining an object's state
and postconditions describing the effects of its operations.`

**IMPORTANT:** `A class is thread-safe if it behaves correctly when accessed from multiple
threads, regardless of the scheduling or interleaving of the execution of
those threads by the runtime environment, and with no additional synchronization or other coordination on the part of
the calling code.`

No set of operations performed sequentially or concurrently on instances of a thread-safe class can
cause an instance to be in an invalid state.

`Thread-safe classes encapsulate any needed synchronization so that
clients need not provide their own.`

### 2.1.1 Example: a stateless servlet

---

Very often, thread-safety requirements stem not
from a decision to use threads directly but from a decision to use a facility like the
Servlets framework.

Stateless servlet:

```java

@ThreadSafe
public class StatelessFactorizer implements Servlet {
    public void service(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse resp) {
        BigInteger i = extractFromRequest(req);
        BigInteger[] factors = factor(i);
        encodeIntoResponse(resp, factors);
    }
}
```

`Stateless objects are always thread-safe.`
